# Code Samples - PRO1001 Frontend Essentials

This repository contains code samples from the course **PRO1001 Frontend Essentials**.

The examples are small and focused, showing core concepts in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript such as DOM manipulation, events, API calls, and asynchronous programming.  

They are provided *out of context* here for educational purposes, but in the course they are tied to the learning material and set in context with theory and practice.  

Feel free to browse, fork, and adapt the material as part of your own learning journey.

Good luck and have fun 😊
